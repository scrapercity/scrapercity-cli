# ScraperCity - B2B Lead Generation for AI Agents

Pull leads, validate emails, find mobile numbers, and scrape business data - all from your AI agent, CLI, or code.

ScraperCity gives AI agents access to 15+ B2B data tools: Apollo scraping, Google Maps extraction, email finding/validation, mobile number lookup, skip tracing, ecommerce store data, criminal records, and more.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: CLI

```bash
npx scrapercity login            # enter your API key
npx scrapercity wallet           # check balance
npx scrapercity maps -q "plumbers" -l "Denver, CO"
npx scrapercity poll <runId>     # wait for results
npx scrapercity download <runId> # save CSV
```

### Option 2: MCP Server (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

Add to your MCP config (e.g. `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scrapercity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "scrapercity", "scrapercity-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SCRAPERCITY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then tell your AI: *"Find 1000 plumbers in Denver with emails using ScraperCity"*

### Option 3: Skill File (Claude Code)

Copy the skill file into your project:

```bash
npx scrapercity-mcp --print-skill > SCRAPERCITY_SKILL.md
```

Or download from: `https://scrapercity.com/agents/SKILL.md`

Then in Claude Code: *"Read SCRAPERCITY_SKILL.md and find me 2000 marketing directors at SaaS companies in California, validate their emails, and save to leads.csv"*

### Option 4: Direct API

```bash
# Start a Maps scrape
curl -X POST https://app.scrapercity.com/api/v1/scrape/maps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRAPERCITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"searchStringsArray":["plumbers"],"locationQuery":"Denver, CO","maxCrawledPlacesPerSearch":500}'

# Check status
curl https://app.scrapercity.com/api/v1/scrape/status/RUN_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRAPERCITY_API_KEY"

# Download CSV when SUCCEEDED
curl -O https://app.scrapercity.com/api/downloads/RUN_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRAPERCITY_API_KEY"
```

## Available Tools

| **Google Maps** | Local businesses with phones, emails, reviews | $0.01/place |

## How It Works

1. **Start a scrape** → get a `runId`
2. **Poll status** (or use webhooks) → wait for `SUCCEEDED`
3. **Download CSV** → leads with full contact info

Apollo scrapes take up to 4 days. All other scrapers: 1-30 minutes. Store leads are instant.
